In the "Inception" project, I focused on expanding my system administration skills through Docker. The challenge was to set up multiple services manually in a virtual environment, each within its own Docker container. This hands-on approach was demanding, pushing me to deepen my understanding of Docker's practical use.

Configuring services like NGINX for secure web hosting, WordPress with php-fpm for content management, and MariaDB for database services required precise manual settings. These needed to communicate within a Docker network, emphasizing security and performance. Writing Dockerfiles from scratch for each service was particularly tough but insightful, teaching me about the nitty-gritty of deployment and configuration without relying on pre-made images.

Handling environment variables and ensuring the secure management of sensitive configurations through a .env file was another crucial learning curve. It underscored the significance of maintaining the integrity of an infrastructure's security.

Moreover, setting up NGINX as the only access point into the infrastructure, via a secure port and protocols, and configuring a domain name pointed to the virtual setup added layers to the challenge.

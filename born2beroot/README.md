## ABOUT
Born2beroot is a system administration project focused on setting up a secure virtual machine. It covers key topics such as virtualization, partitioning, LVM, command-line tools, SSH, and system security measures like sudo, firewalls, and password policies. The project repository includes a script for automated tasks and the virtual machine signature.
